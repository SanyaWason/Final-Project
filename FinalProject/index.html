<br>
As children, we are always taught not to succumb to peer pressure— but what if that pressure is ingrained into the very systems we live in?
<br>
<br>
At a large state university, like the University of Maryland, with over 31,000 undergraduate students and a prominent Greek Life population, drinking is heavily normalized. 
<br>
<br>
In fact, it’s plastered all over the walls: 1 in 4 Terps choose not to drink….meaning 3 out of 4 do. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>Bars and normalization</strong>
<br>
With five main bars for students to frequent and many-a-happy-hour, there are lines out the door for any liquor-serving place past 9p.m. on the weekends. 
<br>
<br>
From Cornerstone Grill and Loft to Looney’s Irish Pub, there’s a place to drink for all kinds of people! 
<br>
<br>
When most people hear ‘the seven days of the week,’ they typically think ‘Monday, Tuesday, etc.’ But, for UMD students, the days are different, and go as follows:
  <li>Messed-up-Monday</li>
  <li>Twisted Tuesday</li>
  <li>Wasted Wednesday</li>
  <li>Thirsty Thursday (the most popular weekday)</li>
  <li>F***ked up Friday</li>
  <li>Slammed Saturday </li>
  <li>Sloshed Sunday</li> 
<br>
<br>
With bars, frat houses and apartment parties, there are many ways for students to take advantage of these adequately-named days of the week.
<br>
<br>
“I think under-aged drinking is really normalized; it’s part of the college experience,” a senior said, reflecting on her experiences as an undergraduate student at the university.

<br>
<br>
Many of the survey respondents said they felt left out if they did not go to social events where drinking occured, which contributed to the cycle of normalization. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>Fake IDs</strong>
<br>
If you walk by the bar lines snaking around the corner, you’ll likely see people staring down at their IDs in a desperate attempt to remember what fake address and birthday they put down, just in case the bouncer asks. 
<br>
<br>
If you go to a bar late enough, where the people in line are already too intoxicated, you’ll notice the walk of shame that follows getting asked your birthday and saying the wrong year. 
<br>
<br>
61% of respondents said they own a fake ID and 6% said that despite not owning one, they’ve used one before. 
<br>
<br>
One person shared a story in which their short, Chinese, friend used a tall, White girl’s fake ID at Looney’s Pub and got in with no questions asked.
<br>
<br>
Bars located in college towns, such as this one, are bound to accept fake IDs and serve underage populations, as they make more money that way.
<br>
<br>
Another respondent shared that they hardly get carded at the bars here, and when they do, no questions are asked about their ID. 
<br>
<br>
Many students, however, are not conceious of the repercussions of possessing a fake ID. While it is likely the offender will just have a misdemeanor, the consequences can be very serious, and even lead to jail time, according to Maryland attorneys. 
<br>
<br>
“I think that people do not care about the repercussions of owning a fake ID…to them, the only crime is underage drinking,” one senior said. “It’s honestly a lack of concern.” 
<br>
<br>
Many survey respondents also said they felt like owning a fake ID was a right of passage, or a necessity to be socially successful.

<br>
One freshman responded to the form admitting that they felt like they had to buy a fake ID and go to bars in order to make friends. 
<br>
<br>
"I rushed into getting an ID and going out and realized it wasn’t worth the money and I didn’t love it", the freshman said.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Sober events</strong>
<br> 
The University of Maryland hosts many events for students, most of which are strictly substance-free. 
<br>
<br>
The school has a program called Terps After Dark, which is meant for “first-year students to feel engaged with the campus community,” according to their <a href= "https://terpsafterdark.umd.edu/" target="_blank"> website</a>. They host late-night, substance-free events for the first six weekends of the Fall semester. 
<br>
<br>
60% of the survey’s respondents expressed being somewhat familiar with this program. 
<br>
<br>
The university also has a program called Terps for Recovery, a student-run organization that hosts strictly-sober events to help community members in their substance recovery process. Many of their events are posted on their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/terps4recovery/" target="_blank"> Instagram </a>. 
<br>
<br>
Only 18% of the survey respondents felt somewhat familiar with this program, leaving 81% of respondents unfamiliar with this resource.

<br>
<br>
<p style="font-size: 18px"> The survey revealed that 40% of respondents believe the university needs to do a better job with advertising their strictly-sober and recovery-supportive events.
<br>
<br>
While many students detailed experiencing pressure to drink, some responses revealed that many people voluntarily drink, and have not experienced any sort of peer pressure while at this university. 
<br>
<br>
“There are so many fun nights out at bars,” one sophomore said. “I understand why some people don't drink, but I always have a great time out!”
